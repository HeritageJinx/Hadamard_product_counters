\section{Introduction}\label{index_Introduction}
This library is a set of classes to make computations on formal series used in Discrete Event Systems. More specifically, these series allow us to describe the behaviour of a subclass of Petri Nets The formal series handled with this library lie on a set of elementary operators used to describe Timed Event Graphs (T\+E\+Gs), Weighted Timed Event Graphs (W\+T\+E\+Gs) and some Timed Event Graphs with time-\/variant sojourn times.
