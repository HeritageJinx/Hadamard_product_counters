This library is a set of classes to make computations on formal series used in the field of Discrete Event Systems. More specifically, these series lie on elementary opertors used to describe Timed Event Graphs (T\+E\+Gs), Weighted Timed Event Graphs (W\+T\+E\+Gs) and some Timed E\+Vent Graphs with time-\/variant sojourn times.
